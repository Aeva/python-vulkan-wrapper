# A simple vulkan wrapper generator for python

I've tried to make it easily customizable in order to generate wrapper for other languages/library without too much trouble.

## Behaviour

By default, the script will fetch the last version of vk.xml in the vulkan repo on github and generate the wrapper in 'vk.py'. If this behaviour
is not desired, it is possible to generate the wrapper from a file by editing "SHARED" data in the source code OR by passing the following arguments to the script

* -s web|file - From where to fetch "vk.xml". "file" use the local filesystem, "web" use a url.
* -p [path]   - Where vk.xml is located. This can be a path or an url (depending on the -s parameter)
* -o [name]   - Write the output script to "name"

Furthermore, it is possible to edit the default templates to add stuff to the wrapper as long as all the formatted fields ("{STUFF}") stay present.

## Usage

```
python create_vulkan_wrapper.py [-s] [-p] [-o]
python create_vulkan_wrapper.py -s file -p xml/vk.xml -o wrapper.py
python create_vulkan_wrapper.py -o foo.py
```

## Example

For an example of how a wrapper generated by this script can be used, please see <https://github.com/gabdube/python-vulkan-triangle>

## Dependencies

This script and the generated wrapper were tested with python3 and python2. There are no external python libraries required.
